Create a program using c++ language which has 4 functions:
1. function for shortest job first
2. function for shortest remaining time first
3. function for round-robin
4. function for recommended time quantum that accepts either vector or array, and can be calculated the optimal time quantum using mean or median

all functions must be executed

The following data types should be abbreviated:
process id, arrival time, completion time, burst time, waiting time, turnaround time, average turnaround time, average waiting time
